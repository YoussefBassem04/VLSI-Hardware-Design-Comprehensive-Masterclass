## ðŸ“˜ Course Content Overview

### 1. **Fundamentals of Digital Logic & VLSI Design**

- Revisits **basic digital building blocks**: gates, flip-flops, combinational/sequential logic
- Discusses **VLSI design flow**, including ASIC vs FPGA distinctions and key considerations

### 2. **Verilog HDL Deep Dive**

- Started with **basic syntax**: modules, ports, data types, `always` blocks, blocking/nonblocking assignments
- Progressed into **good vs bad coding styles**, with clear demonstrations of coding pitfalls and best practices for synthesizable code

### 3. **Designing Core Hardware Modules**

- Implemented **combinational circuits**: muxes, encoders, decoders
- Developed **sequential components**: counters, shift registers, e.g., LFSR, SISO/PISO, FIFOs
- Applied **testbench-driven development**: stimulus generation, `$monitor`, `$dumpvars`, waveform inspection

### 4. **Practical FSM Design**

- Designed both **Mealy and Moore FSMs**, implementing state encoding and nextâ€‘state logic
- Tackled real-world pattern detection tasks (e.g., colorâ€‘sequence detector) with **nonâ€‘overlapping logic** and systematic test benches

### 5. **FPGA/ASIC Design Flow**

- Covered elaboration to implementation steps: **synthesis, simulation, timing analysis**
- Introduced **toolchains and simulation mastery**, including Vivado, Questa/Modelsim, and testbench best practices

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

- **Write synthesis-friendly code**: emphasize proper use of blocking vs nonblocking assignments, guards in combinational logic, complete assignment in all branches
- **Build reusable components**: structured design of counters, shift registers, FIFOs, and FSMs using parameterization
- **Test thoroughly**: systematic testbench development with both directed and random stimulus, use of waveform dumps and validations
- **Understand hardware implications**: clear mapping between HDL code and gate-level hardware, including race conditions, glitches, and latency
- **Kickstart real design flows**: from Verilog to FPGA bitstreamsâ€”capable of designing actual ASIC/FPGA logic
